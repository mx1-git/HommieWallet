# HommieWallet
private key manager application
HommieWallet is a safe, secure, and "user-friendly" interface for managing a complex private key.
This app will incorporate features for password recovery questions, 2-factor authentication, biometric authentication.
This app is specifically intended to prevent scripts from creating a login account by using various "human" tests.
Additional features will be added to recognize a user's computer and prompt with elevated security measures if logging 
in from a new computer.

This app will communicate with other HommieWallet app nodes to further verify users, and store backed-up copies of their 
private key in a fragmented and encrypted state.

Users will be rewarded for helping to validate other user's logins via HommieTokens.   Spam prevention methods will 
include charging users 1 HommieToken per login attempt.   New users will receive 1000 HommieTokens at sign-up, and 
they can earn more by running their copy of the HommieWallet app as well as by referring other users.
